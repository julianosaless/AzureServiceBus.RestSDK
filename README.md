# Project Title: .NET Legacy Integration with Service Bus via REST

## Description
This project addresses the unique challenge of integrating a legacy application, developed over 17 years ago, with modern service bus architectures using RESTful APIs. The application is built on an older version of the .NET framework, which lacks support from some contemporary libraries. This integration facilitates seamless communication between the legacy system and newer service bus technologies, ensuring continued functionality and compatibility in a changing technological landscape.

## Features
- Integration with service bus using RESTful APIs.
- Compatibility with older .NET framework versions.
- Seamless communication between legacy applications and modern service infrastructure.
- Robust error handling and logging for easier maintenance.

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
- .NET Framework (specific version used in legacy application)
- Any specific libraries or tools required for the older .NET version
- Service bus platform (specify any particular version or provider if needed)

### Installing
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed and configured.
- Follow the setup instructions specific to your service bus platform.

### Configuration
- Update the configuration files with your service bus credentials and endpoints.
- Adjust any specific settings related to the legacy application environment.

## Usage
Provide a brief guide on how to use the integration:
1. Start the legacy application.
2. Ensure the service bus is running and accessible.
3. Trigger the integration through the specified method (e.g., a RESTful request).
4. Monitor the logs for any communication or error messages.
